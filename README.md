## Tech Decisions
### Backend
I choose to use Sinatra because its a very lightweight framework. Ideal for these simple functional requirements. 
If the requirements were a little more complex, I'd choose to use Ruby on Rails 6 in API mode because I've much more experience with it.

For testing, I use Rspec which is the most popular testing framework for Ruby and I use it a daily basis.
